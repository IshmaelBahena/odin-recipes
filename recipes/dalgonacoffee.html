    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Dalgona coffee is a whipped coffee drink made with instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and milk. It became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic as a fun and easy way to make a fancy coffee drink at home. The coffee mixture is whipped until it becomes light and frothy, then spooned over a glass of milk, creating a layered effect. The result is a creamy, sweet, and visually appealing beverage.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee</li>
